This is an app I am creating with Android Studio for a client. I am currently using a webhost that has JSON file uploaded to run my ListView and also using Google's Volley Library instead of AsyncTask. Have been able to get things running smoothly but have been stuck recently in some part that still haven't been able to solve in which I would like NetworkImageView open certain images in fullscreen when I click on the resize images. Hope I can get help here and contribute at the same time :)
