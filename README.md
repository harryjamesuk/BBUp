This is an app I am creating with Android Studio for a client. I am currently using a webhost that has JSON file uploaded to run my ListView and also using Google's Volley Library instead of AsyncTask. Currently working in getting NetworkImageView open certain images in fullscreen when I click on the resize images. Hope to contribute and get support at the same time. :)
